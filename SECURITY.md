3. **Include Details**: In your email, provide a clear description of the vulnerability, the steps to reproduce it, and any relevant supporting information such as affected versions or configurations.
4. **Encryption**: To encrypt your message, you can use our PGP key. Please request our PGP key in the initial email, and we will send it to you.
5. **Acknowledgment**: After receiving your report, we will acknowledge the receipt of the vulnerability report as soon as possible and within 48 hours.
6. **Assessment**: W will assess and investigate the reported vulnerability to verify its validity and impact.
